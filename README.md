# Health Bot Container

**Note:** In order to use this Web Chat with the Health Bot service, you will need to obtain your Web Chat secret by going to ["Integration/Secrets"](./secrets.png) on the navigation panel.
Please refer to [Microsoft Health Bot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/health-bot/) for a private preview and details.

A simple web page to hand off users to the Microsoft Health bot

1. Deploy the website:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

2.Set the following environment variables:

`APP_SECRET`

`WEBCHAT_SECRET`

3.Set the Bot service direct line channel endpoint (optional)

In some cases it is required to set the endpoint URI so that it points to a specific geography. The geographies supported by the bot service each have a unique direct line endpoint URI:

- `directline.botframework.com` routes your client to the nearest datacenter. This is the best option if you do not know where your client is located.
- `asia.directline.botframework.com` routes only to Direct Line servers in Eastern Asia.
- `europe.directline.botframework.com` routes only to Direct Line servers in Europe.
- `northamerica.directline.botframework.com` routes only to Direct Line servers in North America.

Pass your preferred geographic endpoint URI by setting the environment variable: `DIRECTLINE_ENDPOINT_URI` in your deployment. If no variable is found it will default to `directline.botframework.com`

**Note:** If you are deploying the code sample using the "Deploy to Azure" option, you should add the above secrets to the application settings for your App Service. 

## Agent webchat
If the agent webchat sample is also required, [switch to the live agent handoff branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/HealthBotContainerSample/tree/live_agent_handoff)
